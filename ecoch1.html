                <h3>What is Development?</h3>
                <p>Development is a multidimensional concept that encompasses not just economic growth but also improvements in health, education, equality, and overall well-being of people. It involves positive changes that make life better for individuals and communities.</p>
                
                <div class="key-points">
                    <h4>Key Aspects of Development:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Economic Growth:</strong> Increase in production and income</li>
                        <li><strong>Social Progress:</strong> Improvements in health, education, and living standards</li>
                        <li><strong>Political Freedom:</strong> Democratic rights and participation</li>

                <h3>Different People, Different Goals</h3>
                <p>Development means different things to different people based on their circumstances, needs, and aspirations. What may be development for one person might not be the same for another.</p>
                
                <div class="example-box">
                    <h4>Examples:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>For a landless farmer:</strong> Getting land, better seeds, and irrigation facilities</li>
                        <li><strong>For an urban unemployed youth:</strong> Getting a job with decent wages</li>
                        <li><strong>For a girl child:</strong> Access to education and freedom from discrimination</li>

                <h2>2. Income and Other Goals</h2>
                
                <h3>Importance of Income</h3>
                <p>Income is undoubtedly an important component of development as it provides the means to fulfill basic needs like food, clothing, shelter, education, and healthcare. Higher income generally leads to better living standards.</p>
                
                <div class="key-points">
                    <h4>Why Income Matters:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Enables purchase of basic necessities</li>
                        <li>Provides access to better education and healthcare</li>
                        <li>Improves quality of housing and living conditions</li>
                        <li>Offers more choices and opportunities</li>
                        <li>Enhances social status and respect</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                
                <h3>Beyond Income - Non-Material Goals</h3>
                <p>However, income alone cannot determine development. People also seek non-material things that are equally important for a fulfilling life.</p>
                
                <div class="key-points">
                    <h4>Non-Material Aspects of Development:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Security:</strong> Personal and economic security</li>
                        <li><strong>Respect and Dignity:</strong> Social recognition and equality</li>
                        <li><strong>Freedom:</strong> Political and personal freedoms</li>
                        <li><strong>Clean Environment:</strong> Pollution-free air, water, and surroundings</li>
                        <li><strong>Peace:</strong> Absence of conflict and violence</li>
                        <li><strong>Equal Treatment:</strong> Non-discrimination based on gender, caste, religion</li>
                        <li><strong>Democratic Rights:</strong> Right to vote, express opinions, participate in governance</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                
                <div class="example-box">
                    <h4>Real-life Example:</h4>
                    <p>Consider two states in India - Punjab and Kerala. Punjab has higher per capita income than Kerala, but Kerala has better literacy rates, lower infant mortality, and higher life expectancy. This shows that development is not just about income but also about social indicators.</p>

                <h3>What is National Development?</h3>
                <p>National development refers to the overall progress of a country in various spheres - economic, social, political, and environmental. It aims to improve the standard of living of all citizens.</p>

                <h3>Challenges in Defining National Development</h3>
                <p>Since different people have different developmental goals, it becomes challenging to define what constitutes national development. What might be development for one group might be harmful to another.</p>

                    <h4>Conflicting Developmental Goals:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Dam Construction:</strong> Provides electricity and irrigation (beneficial for urban areas and farmers) but displaces tribal communities</li>
                        <li><strong>Industrial Development:</strong> Creates jobs and economic growth but may cause environmental pollution</li>
                        <li><strong>Mining:</strong> Generates revenue and employment but destroys forests and affects local communities</li>

                <p>For national development, we need to think about what would be the best for the largest number of people. The development goals that are beneficial for the majority should be given priority.</p>
                
                <div class="key-points">

                <h3>Need for Comparison</h3>
                <p>To understand the level of development, we need to compare different countries or states. This helps in identifying successful development models and learning from best practices.</p>
                
                <h3>Income as a Development Indicator</h3>
                <p>Income is the most commonly used criterion for comparing development levels. Countries with higher income are generally considered more developed.</p>
                
                <div class="key-points">
                    <h4>Why Income is Used for Comparison:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Easy to measure and quantify</li>
                        <li>Available for most countries</li>
                        <li>Reflects economic prosperity</li>
                        <li>Enables purchase of essential goods and services</li>
                        <li>Generally correlates with better living standards</li>

                <p>Per capita income is calculated by dividing the total income of the country by its total population. It gives us an average figure of how much each person would earn if the income were distributed equally.</p>
                
                <div class="example-box">
                    <h4>Example Calculation:</h4>
                    <p>If India's total national income is ₹150 lakh crores and population is 130 crores, then:</p>
                    <p>Per Capita Income = ₹150 lakh crores ÷ 130 crores = ₹1,15,385 per person per year</p>
