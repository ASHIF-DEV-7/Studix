                <p>The war led to a sharp increase in **defense expenditure**, financed by war loans and increased taxes. This created an **inflationary period** with rising prices.

            <div class="answer">
                <p>Power sharing is a system where power is shared among different organs and levels of government, and different social groups. It is desirable because it **reduces conflict** between social groups, ensures **stability**, and upholds the spirit of democracy.</p>

            <div class="answer">
                <p>In a **federal system**, power is divided between a central authority and constituent units, with both having their own jurisdiction.

            <div class="answer">
                <p>Political parties are crucial for the functioning of democracy. They **contest elections**, **form governments**, and **act as the opposition** to hold the government accountable.

            <div class="answer">
                <p>Caste influences Indian politics as parties often field candidates from castes dominant in a particular constituency.

            <div class="answer">

            <div class="question">Q23. What is 'disguised unemployment'? Give an example. (2023)</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Disguised unemployment is a situation where more people are employed in a sector than are actually needed, with their contribution to output being zero or negligible.

            <div class="question">Q24. How does the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) supervise the functioning of formal sources of loans? (2022)</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>The RBI supervises banks to ensure they lend not just to profit-making businesses but also to small borrowers and farmers.

        <div class="question-block">
            <div class="question">Q25. Explain the role of 'money' as a medium of exchange. (2022)</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Money acts as a medium of exchange because it can be used to purchase goods and services. It solves the problem of **'double coincidence of wants'**, which is required in a barter system. With money, a buyer doesn't need to find a seller who wants exactly what the buyer has in exchange for what they need.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question-block">
            <div class="question">Q26. What are 'self-help groups' (SHGs)? How do they help the poor? (2023)</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>SHGs are small groups, mostly of women, who pool their savings and provide small loans to members at a reasonable interest rate. They help the poor by providing an alternative to formal loans, which often require collateral. They also help members become financially self-reliant and create a platform for social and economic empowerment.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question-block">
            <div class="question">Q27. Differentiate between a formal and an informal sector loan. (2022)</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>**Formal sector loans** are from banks and cooperatives, regulated by the RBI, and have low interest rates and set terms. **Informal sector loans** are from moneylenders and traders, are not regulated, and often have very high interest rates and exploitative terms. The formal sector is preferable as it offers fair and transparent conditions.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question-block">
            <div class="question">Q28. How has globalization affected the Indian economy? (2023)</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Globalization has led to increased competition for domestic producers, but also new opportunities. Consumers now have a wider range of products at lower prices. It has created new jobs in sectors like IT and BPO. However, it has also led to job losses in some industries and increased economic inequality.</p>

            <div class="answer">
                <p>Soil erosion is the denudation of the soil cover and subsequent washing down of the topsoil.
