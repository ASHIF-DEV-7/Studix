            <h2>The Poem</h2>
            <div class="poem">
                <p>What is the boy now, who has lost his ball,<br>
                What, what is he to do? I saw it go<br>
                Merrily bouncing, down the street, and then<br>
                Merrily over—there it is in the water!<br>
                No use to say 'O there are other balls':</p>
                
                <p>An ultimate shaking grief fixes the boy<br>
                As he stands rigid, trembling, staring down<br>
                All his young days into the harbour where<br>
                His ball went. I would not intrude on him,<br>
                A dime, another ball, is worthless.</p>
                
                <p>Now he senses first responsibility<br>
                In a world of possessions. People will take<br>
                Balls, balls will be lost always, little boy.<br>
                And no one buys a ball back. Money is external.</p>
                
                <p>He is learning, well behind his desperate eyes,<br>
                The epistemology of loss, how to stand up<br>
                Knowing what every man must one day know<br>
                And most know many days, how to stand up.</p>

            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>The poem begins with a boy who loses his ball while playing. The ball bounces away and lands in the water. The boy is deeply affected by this loss and stands frozen, grieving for his lost possession.</p>
            
            <p>The poet reflects that offering the boy money or a new ball would be meaningless. This experience teaches the boy about responsibility and the nature of loss in a world where possessions come and go.</p>
