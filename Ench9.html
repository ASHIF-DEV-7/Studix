  <h2>Explanation – 20 Points</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>1.</strong> Lomov visits Chubukov’s house to ask for Natalya’s hand in marriage.</li>
    <li><strong>2.</strong> He is dressed formally and appears nervous and hesitant.</li>
    <li><strong>3.</strong> Chubukov warmly welcomes Lomov, guessing his purpose.</li>
    <li><strong>4.</strong> Lomov tries to talk about marriage but digresses repeatedly.</li>
    <li><strong>5.</strong> He begins a conversation about a disputed piece of land called Oxen Meadows.</li>
    <li><strong>6.</strong> Natalya enters, and a heated argument starts over the ownership of the Meadows.</li>
    <li><strong>7.</strong> Both families claim the land belongs to them.</li>
    <li><strong>8.</strong> The quarrel escalates, and Lomov becomes agitated.</li>
    <li><strong>9.</strong> Chubukov joins the argument, supporting his daughter.</li>
    <li><strong>10.</strong> Lomov, already weak-hearted, feels faint but refuses to leave.</li>
    <li><strong>11.</strong> After Lomov exits, Chubukov informs Natalya of Lomov’s proposal intention.</li>
    <li><strong>12.</strong> Natalya panics, realizing she may lose the chance of marriage.</li>
    <li><strong>13.</strong> She calls Lomov back immediately.</li>
    <li><strong>14.</strong> When Lomov returns, she changes the topic and acts politely.</li>
    <li><strong>15.</strong> Soon another quarrel begins about whose hunting dog is superior—Guess or Squeezer.</li>
    <li><strong>16.</strong> Lomov, already anxious, collapses on a chair, almost unconscious.</li>
    <li><strong>17.</strong> Chubukov splashes water and revives him.</li>
    <li><strong>18.</strong> Despite continuous quarrels, Chubukov quickly announces their engagement.</li>
    <li><strong>19.</strong> The couple continues to argue even after the engagement is confirmed.</li>
    <li><strong>20.</strong> The play ends humorously, showing marriage as a social contract rather than a romantic union.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Conclusion (7–8 Lines)</h2>

  <p><strong>4.</strong> Marriage, in this story, becomes a mere social arrangement. </p>
  <p><strong>5.</strong> The ending proves that people often value status and land over emotions. </p>
  <p><strong>6.</strong> Humor is used to point out serious flaws in society. </p>
  <p><strong>7.</strong> Chekhov leaves readers amused but thoughtful about human follies. </p>

  <h2>Moral of the Story</h2>
  <p><strong>The moral:</strong> Human pride, greed, and social status often overshadow genuine feelings. Relationships should be built on love and understanding, not on wealth, land, or superficial arguments.</p>
