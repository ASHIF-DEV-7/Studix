    <h1>Class 10 Chemistry Previous Year Questions (2024) with Answers</h1>
    <ol>
        <li class="question">Explain the law of conservation of mass with an example of a balanced chemical equation. (3 marks)
            <p class="answer">Answer: The law of conservation of mass states that mass can neither be created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction; it remains constant. Example: In the decomposition of calcium carbonate, CaCO₃ → CaO + CO₂, the mass of CaCO₃ equals the mass of CaO + CO₂.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="question">Classify the following reaction as combination, decomposition, displacement, or double displacement, and explain why: 2Pb(NO₃)₂ → 2PbO + 4NO₂ + O₂. (3 marks)
            <p class="answer">Answer: This is a decomposition reaction because a single compound breaks down into two or more simpler substances upon heating.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="question">Write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction between zinc and dilute sulphuric acid, and state the type of reaction. (3 marks)
            <p class="answer">Answer: Zn + H₂SO₄ → ZnSO₄ + H₂. This is a displacement reaction as zinc displaces hydrogen from the acid.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="question">What is rancidity? Suggest two methods to prevent it in food items. (3 marks)
            <p class="answer">Answer: Rancidity is the oxidation of fats and oils in food leading to bad smell and taste. Prevention: Adding antioxidants like BHT; storing food in air-tight containers or nitrogen gas flushing.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="question">Identify the substance oxidized and reduced in the reaction: CuO + H₂ → Cu + H₂O. Justify your answer. (3 marks)
            <p class="answer">Answer: H₂ is oxidized (loses electrons, gain of oxygen), CuO is reduced (gains electrons, loss of oxygen). It's a redox reaction.</p>

        <li class="question">Describe the process of electrolysis of water with a labelled diagram in words, and write the electrode reactions. (4 marks)
            <p class="answer">Answer: Electrolysis of water uses electric current to decompose water into H₂ and O₂. At cathode: 2H₂O + 2e⁻ → H₂ + 2OH⁻; At anode: 4OH⁻ → O₂ + 2H₂O + 4e⁻. (Diagram: Electrolytic cell with electrodes in acidified water.)</p>
