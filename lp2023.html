            <div class="question">1. Define the principal focus of a concave mirror.</div>
            <div class="answer">The principal focus of a concave mirror is a point on the principal axis where all the light rays which are parallel to the principal axis converge after reflection from the concave mirror.</div>

        <div class="question-container">
            <div class="question">2. The radius of curvature of a spherical mirror is 20 cm. What is its focal length?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <div class="formula">Focal length (f) = Radius of curvature (R) / 2</div>
                Given R = 20 cm<br>
                f = R/2 = 20/2 = 10 cm<br>
                So, the focal length is 10 cm.

            <div class="answer">We prefer a convex mirror as a rear-view mirror in vehicles because:

                    <li>It always produces an erect image</li>
                    <li>It has a wider field of view compared to plane or concave mirrors</li>

                <div class="formula">Using mirror formula: 1/f = 1/v + 1/u</div>
                Given: Object distance, u = -10 cm (using Cartesian sign convention)<br>

                1/15 = 1/v + 1/(-10)<br>
                1/v = 1/15 + 1/10 = (2 + 3)/30 = 5/30 = 1/6<br>
                So, v = +6 cm<br><br>
                
                The positive sign indicates that the image is formed behind the mirror.<br>
                Magnification, m = -v/u = -6/(-10) = 0.6<br>

            <div class="answer">
                Given: Object height, h = 4 cm<br>
                Object distance, u = -15 cm (using Cartesian sign convention)<br>
                Focal length, f = -10 cm (for concave mirror)<br><br>
                
                Using mirror formula: 1/f = 1/v + 1/u<br>
                1/(-10) = 1/v + 1/(-15)<br>
                -1/10 = 1/v - 1/15<br>
                1/v = -1/10 + 1/15 = (-3 + 2)/30 = -1/30<br>
                So, v = -30 cm<br><br>
                
                The negative sign indicates that the image is formed in front of the mirror.<br>
                Magnification, m = -v/u = -(-30)/(-15) = 30/(-15) = -2<br>
                The negative magnification indicates that the image is inverted.<br>
                |m| = 2 > 1, so the image is enlarged.<br><br>
                
                Size of image, h' = m × h = -2 × 4 = -8 cm<br>
                The negative sign indicates the image is inverted, and its size is 8 cm.

            <div class="answer">
                Given: Object distance, u = -20 cm<br>
                Image distance, v = -40 cm (since real image is formed in front of the mirror)<br><br>
                
                Using mirror formula: 1/f = 1/v + 1/u<br>
                1/f = 1/(-40) + 1/(-20) = -1/40 - 1/20 = -1/40 - 2/40 = -3/40<br>
                So, f = -40/3 ≈ -13.33 cm<br>
                The focal length is approximately 13.33 cm (negative sign indicates it's a concave mirror).

            <div class="answer">A convex mirror is used as a reflector in street lamps because it diverges the light rays over a wider area, thus spreading the light and illuminating a larger area of the road.</div>

        <div class="question-container">
            <div class="question">16. An object 2 cm high is placed at a distance of 16 cm from a concave mirror which produces a real image 4 cm high. Find the focal length of the mirror.</div>
            <div class="answer">
                Given: Object height, h = 2 cm<br>
                Image height, h' = -4 cm (negative since real image is inverted)<br>
                Object distance, u = -16 cm<br><br>
                
                Magnification, m = h'/h = -4/2 = -2<br>
                Also, m = -v/u<br>
                So, -2 = -v/(-16) => -2 = v/16 => v = -32 cm<br><br>
                
                Using mirror formula: 1/f = 1/v + 1/u<br>
                1/f = 1/(-32) + 1/(-16) = -1/32 - 2/32 = -3/32<br>
                So, f = -32/3 ≈ -10.67 cm<br>
                The focal length is approximately 10.67 cm.

                So, 5 images will be formed.

                (a) <strong>Focal length</strong>: The distance between the pole and the principal focus of a mirror.<br>
                (b) <strong>Aperture</strong>: The diameter of the reflecting surface of the mirror.<br>
                (c) <strong>Radius of curvature</strong>: The radius of the sphere of which the mirror is a part.

            <div class="question">19. An object is placed at a distance of 12 cm from a convex mirror of focal length 15 cm. Find the position and magnification of the image.</div>
            <div class="answer">
                Given: Object distance, u = -12 cm<br>
                Focal length, f = +15 cm (for convex mirror)<br><br>
                
                Using mirror formula: 1/f = 1/v + 1/u<br>
                1/15 = 1/v + 1/(-12)<br>
                1/v = 1/15 + 1/12 = (4 + 5)/60 = 9/60 = 3/20<br>
                So, v = +20/3 ≈ +6.67 cm<br><br>
                
                The positive sign indicates that the image is formed behind the mirror.<br>
                Magnification, m = -v/u = -(20/3)/(-12) = (20/3)/12 = 20/36 = 5/9 ≈ 0.56<br>
                The positive magnification less than 1 indicates that the image is virtual, erect and diminished.
