  <h1>Science 2022 Previous Year Questions</h1>  <div class="qa">
    <div class="question">1. What is the difference between a physical change and a chemical change?</div>
    <div class="answer">A physical change alters the state or appearance without forming a new substance, while a chemical change produces one or more new substances.</div><div class="question">2. Define acids and bases with examples.</div>
<div class="answer">Acids: substances that release H+ ions (e.g., HCl). Bases: substances that release OH- ions (e.g., NaOH).</div>

<div class="question">3. What is the law of conservation of mass?</div>
<div class="answer">In a chemical reaction, mass of reactants equals mass of products; mass is neither created nor destroyed.</div>

<div class="question">4. Explain the structure of an atom.</div>
<div class="answer">An atom consists of a nucleus containing protons and neutrons, surrounded by electrons in shells.</div>

<div class="question">5. What are metals and non-metals?</div>
<div class="answer">Metals are shiny, malleable, ductile, and good conductors; non-metals are dull, brittle, and poor conductors.</div>

<div class="question">6. What is the difference between an element and a compound?</div>
<div class="answer">An element has only one type of atom; a compound contains two or more elements chemically combined.</div>

<div class="question">7. Define reproduction in plants.</div>
<div class="answer">Reproduction is the biological process by which plants produce new individuals, either sexually or asexually.</div>

<div class="question">8. What is heredity?</div>
<div class="answer">Heredity is the passing of traits from parents to offspring through genes.</div>

<div class="question">9. Explain control and coordination in humans.</div>
<div class="answer">Control and coordination involve the nervous and endocrine systems regulating body functions and responses to stimuli.</div>

<div class="question">10. What are carbohydrates, proteins, and fats?</div>
<div class="answer">Carbohydrates provide energy, proteins are for growth and repair, fats store energy and insulate the body.</div>

<div class="question">11. What is photosynthesis?</div>
<div class="answer">Process by which green plants produce food from carbon dioxide and water using sunlight and chlorophyll.</div>

<div class="question">12. Define respiration in humans.</div>
<div class="answer">Respiration is the process of releasing energy from food, can be aerobic (with O2) or anaerobic (without O2).</div>

<div class="question">13. What is the role of xylem and phloem in plants?</div>
<div class="answer">Xylem transports water and minerals; phloem transports food from leaves to other parts.</div>

<div class="question">14. What is the difference between aerobic and anaerobic respiration?</div>
<div class="answer">Aerobic uses oxygen to release energy; anaerobic occurs without oxygen, producing less energy and lactic acid or ethanol.</div>

<div class="question">15. Define alloy and give examples.</div>
<div class="answer">An alloy is a mixture of metals or metal with non-metal to improve properties. Examples: steel, brass, bronze.</div>

<div class="question">16. Explain the water cycle.</div>
<div class="answer">Water evaporates, condenses to form clouds, and precipitates as rain, repeating continuously.</div>

<div class="question">17. What is the importance of soil in agriculture?</div>
<div class="answer">Soil provides nutrients, water, and support to plants for growth.</div>

<div class="question">18. Define biodiversity.</div>
<div class="answer">Biodiversity is the variety of life forms in a particular habitat or ecosystem.</div>

<div class="question">19. What are enzymes?</div>
<div class="answer">Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions in the body without being consumed.</div>

<div class="question">20. Explain the principle of inheritance.</div>
<div class="answer">Traits are inherited from parents through genes and alleles, determining the characteristics of offspring.</div>

<div class="question">21. What is a mixture and its types?</div>
<div class="answer">A mixture is a physical combination of two or more substances. Types: homogeneous and heterogeneous.</div>

<div class="question">22. What is neutralization reaction?</div>
<div class="answer">Reaction between an acid and a base to form salt and water.</div>

<div class="question">23. Explain the periodic table.</div>
<div class="answer">The periodic table arranges elements by increasing atomic number, showing patterns in properties.</div>

<div class="question">24. What is chemical reaction?</div>
<div class="answer">A process in which substances react to form new substances with different properties.</div>

<div class="question">25. Explain decomposition reaction with example.</div>
<div class="answer">A reaction where a compound breaks into simpler substances. Example: 2H2O → 2H2 + O2.</div>

<div class="question">26. What is combustion?</div>
<div class="answer">Combustion is a reaction of a substance with oxygen producing heat and light.</div>

<div class="question">27. Define metals and their properties.</div>
<div class="answer">Metals are solid, shiny, malleable, ductile, and conduct heat and electricity.</div>

<div class="question">28. Define non-metals and their properties.</div>
<div class="answer">Non-metals are brittle, dull, poor conductors, and may exist in solid, liquid, or gas state.</div>

<div class="question">29. What is the significance of control and coordination in plants?</div>
<div class="answer">Hormones in plants coordinate growth, response to stimuli, and adaptation to environment.</div>

<div class="question">30. Explain reproductive strategies in plants.</div>
<div class="answer">Plants reproduce sexually via seeds and asexually via budding, cutting, or vegetative propagation.</div>

<div class="question">31. What are carbohydrates?</div>
<div class="answer">Organic compounds made of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen; main energy source for body.</div>

<div class="question">32. What is the difference between physical and chemical properties?</div>
<div class="answer">Physical properties can be observed without changing substance; chemical properties describe reactivity.</div>

<div class="question">33. Define acid-base indicators.</div>
<div class="answer">Substances that change color in acids or bases to indicate pH level, e.g., litmus, phenolphthalein.</div>

<div class="question">34. What is a chemical formula?</div>
<div class="answer">Representation of a compound showing types and numbers of atoms present.</div>

<div class="question">35. Explain the role of chlorophyll in photosynthesis.</div>
<div class="answer">Chlorophyll absorbs sunlight and converts it into chemical energy for making food.</div>

<div class="question">36. What is the role of digestive enzymes?</div>
<div class="answer">Enzymes help break down food into absorbable nutrients efficiently.</div>

<div class="question">37. What is the role of excretory system?</div>
<div class="answer">Removes metabolic wastes and maintains chemical balance in body fluids.</div>

<div class="question">38. Define nitrogen cycle.</div>
<div class="answer">Process of nitrogen conversion between atmosphere, soil, plants, and animals, maintaining ecosystem balance.</div>

<div class="question">39. Explain the process of osmosis.</div>
<div class="answer">Osmosis is the movement of water molecules from low to high solute concentration through a semi-permeable membrane.</div>
