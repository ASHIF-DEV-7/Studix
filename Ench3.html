        <h2>Conclusion (7–8 Lines)</h2>
        <p>
        Both stories teach that fear is natural but can be conquered with courage and faith.  
        The young seagull learns to fly only when he dares to take the first leap.  
        The pilot in *Black Aeroplane* trusts an unknown guide and survives a deadly storm.  
        These experiences highlight the power of self-belief and unseen help in critical moments.  
        They remind us that life often demands bold decisions despite uncertainty.  
        Facing challenges head-on reveals inner strength we never knew we had.  
        Together, these tales inspire confidence and trust in both ourselves and mysterious forces of nature.  
        Ultimately, they celebrate the triumph of courage over fear.
