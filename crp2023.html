System: I notice the last question appears incomplete ("Why are some reactions reversible? Give an example. (4–"). I'll complete the HTML file by finishing the 40th question, ensuring all 40 questions are 3-4 marks, focused on "Chemical Reactions and Equations" for Class 10 Chemistry (2023), and maintain the simple structure with minimal CSS. The questions and answers will continue to align with the typical Class 10 syllabus (e.g., CBSE) for this chapter, covering reaction types, balancing, redox, corrosion, and rancidity. I'll ensure the final question is complete and fits the 3-4 mark range.

Here’s the corrected and complete HTML file:
