                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Nationalism is a sense of identity with the nation. In the 19th century, Europe witnessed the rise of nationalism which led to the formation of nation-states. The French Revolution of 1789 was the first clear expression of nationalism.</p>
                
                <div class="definition">
                    <strong>Nation-State:</strong> A nation-state is one in which the majority of people share a common identity based on shared history, culture, language, and territory.

            <div class="section">
                <h2>1. The French Revolution and the Idea of the Nation</h2>
                <p>The French Revolution of 1789 was the first major event that led to the rise of nationalism in Europe. It introduced several revolutionary changes:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Transfer of sovereignty from the monarchy to the body of French citizens</li>
                    <li>The ideas of <em>la patrie</em> (the fatherland) and <em>le citoyen</em> (the citizen) emphasized the notion of a united community</li>
                    <li>A new French flag (tricolor) replaced the royal standard</li>
                    <li>The Estates General was renamed the National Assembly</li>
                    <li>Internal customs duties were abolished and uniform system of weights and measures was adopted</li>
                    <li>French became the common language of the nation</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="key-point">
                    <strong>Napoleon Bonaparte:</strong> He declared himself Emperor of France in 1804. Through his conquests, he spread the ideas of nationalism across Europe. However, he was also seen as a conqueror who threatened the sovereignty of other nations.

                <h2>2. The Making of Nationalism in Europe</h2>
                
                <h3>2.1 The Aristocracy and the New Middle Class</h3>
                <p>In the 18th century, European society was dominated by the aristocracy who owned estates and spoke French. However, the growth of towns and commercial classes led to the emergence of a new middle class who believed in individual freedom and equality.</p>

                <h3>2.2 Liberal Nationalism</h3>
                <div class="definition">
                    <strong>Liberalism:</strong> Derived from the Latin word 'liber' meaning free. For the middle class, liberalism meant individual freedom, equality before law, and government by consent. It also emphasized free markets and abolition of state-imposed restrictions.
                </div>

                <h3>2.3 A New Conservatism after 1815</h3>
                <p>After Napoleon's defeat in 1815, European governments were driven by the spirit of conservatism. The Congress of Vienna (1815) was held to restore monarchies that had been overthrown by Napoleon.</p>

                <div class="key-point">
                    <strong>Congress of Vienna (1815):</strong> Led by Austrian Chancellor Duke Metternich. Its main objective was to restore the old regime and create a balance of power to prevent future conflicts.

                <h2>3. The Age of Revolutions: 1830-1848</h2>
                
                <h3>3.1 The Revolutionaries</h3>
                <p>During the 1830s and 1840s, Europe saw a series of revolutions led by liberal-nationalists. Secret societies were formed to train revolutionaries and spread nationalist ideas.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Giuseppe Mazzini:</strong> An Italian revolutionary who founded two secret societies - Young Italy and Young Europe - to unify Italy</li>
                    <li><strong>July Revolution (1830):</strong> Bourbon monarchy was overthrown in France and a constitutional monarchy established</li>
                    <li><strong>Greek War of Independence (1821-1829):</strong> Greece gained independence from Ottoman Empire with support from European powers</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3.2 The Romantic Imagination and National Feeling</h3>
                <p>Romanticism was a cultural movement that emphasized emotions, intuition, and mystical feelings. Romantic artists and poets helped create a sense of shared collective heritage and common cultural past.</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Folk songs, dances, and poetry were collected and popularized</li>
                    <li>Language became important in building national identity</li>
                    <li>German philosopher Johann Gottfried Herder claimed that true German culture was among the common people</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3.3 Hunger, Hardship and Popular Revolt</h3>
                <p>The 1830s were years of great economic hardship in Europe. Population growth led to unemployment and food shortages. In 1848, a revolution led by the educated middle classes took place in France, leading to the abdication of the monarch.</p>

                <div class="important">
                    <strong>Revolution of 1848:</strong> Also called the "Revolution of the Liberals," it swept across Europe demanding constitutions, national unification, and civil liberties. However, most revolutions were crushed by conservative forces.

                <h2>4. The Making of Germany and Italy</h2>
                
                <h3>4.1 Germany - Can the Army be the Architect of a Nation?</h3>
                <p>After 1848, nationalism in Germany was led by Prussia. Chief Minister Otto von Bismarck carried out the unification of Germany through a policy of "blood and iron."</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Three wars</strong> were fought over seven years (1864-1871):
                        <ol>
                            <li>War with Denmark (1864)</li>
                            <li>War with Austria (1866)</li>
                            <li>War with France (1870-71)</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>In January 1871, Prussian King William I was proclaimed German Emperor at Versailles</li>
                    <li>Germany was now a nation-state with the Prussian model of government</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>4.2 Italy Unified</h3>
                <p>Italy was divided into seven states in the mid-19th century. The unification process involved three key figures:</p>
                
                <div class="key-point">
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Giuseppe Mazzini:</strong> Founded Young Italy and inspired the unification movement</li>
                        <li><strong>Count Camillo de Cavour:</strong> Chief Minister of Sardinia-Piedmont who led the diplomatic efforts through tactful alliances</li>
                        <li><strong>Giuseppe Garibaldi:</strong> Led armed volunteers (Red Shirts) to liberate southern Italy</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <p>In 1861, Victor Emmanuel II was proclaimed King of united Italy. However, Rome remained under the Pope until 1870 when it was finally incorporated into Italy.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>5. Visualizing the Nation</h2>
                <p>Nations were often personified as female figures during this period:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Marianne:</strong> Symbol of France, representing liberty and the republic</li>
                    <li><strong>Germania:</strong> Symbol of the German nation, depicted wearing a crown of oak leaves</li>
                    <li>These allegories helped people identify with the abstract idea of the nation</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>6. Nationalism and Imperialism</h2>
                <p>By the last quarter of the 19th century, nationalism became a narrow creed with limited ends. Major European powers began to compete for colonies and resources, leading to imperialism.</p>

                <div class="important">
                    <strong>Balkan Problem:</strong> The Balkans was a region of ethnic and religious diversity. As the Ottoman Empire weakened, Balkan peoples demanded independence. Rivalry between European powers over this region led to a series of wars and eventually contributed to World War I in 1914.
