  <h1>Physics 2024 Previous Year Questions</h1>  <div class="qa">
    <div class="question">1. State the laws of reflection of light.</div>
    <div class="answer">1) Angle of incidence equals angle of reflection. 2) Incident ray, reflected ray, and normal lie in the same plane.</div><div class="question">2. What is the speed of light in vacuum?</div>
<div class="answer">The speed of light in vacuum is approximately 3 × 10⁸ m/s.</div>

<div class="question">3. Define refraction of light.</div>
<div class="answer">Refraction is the bending of light when it passes from one medium to another due to change in speed.</div>

<div class="question">4. What is the focal length of a lens?</div>
<div class="answer">The focal length is the distance between the optical center of a lens and its principal focus.</div>

<div class="question">5. Explain the phenomenon of dispersion of light.</div>
<div class="answer">Dispersion is the splitting of white light into its constituent colors when it passes through a prism.</div>

<div class="question">6. Define power of a lens.</div>
<div class="answer">The power of a lens is the reciprocal of its focal length in meters. P = 1/f.</div>

<div class="question">7. What is magnification?</div>
<div class="answer">Magnification is the ratio of the height of the image to the height of the object. M = v/u for lenses.</div>

<div class="question">8. State Snell's law.</div>
<div class="answer">Snell's law: n₁ sin i = n₂ sin r, where n₁ and n₂ are refractive indices, i is angle of incidence, r is angle of refraction.</div>

<div class="question">9. What is the difference between real and virtual image?</div>
<div class="answer">A real image is formed when rays actually meet, can be projected; a virtual image is formed when rays appear to meet, cannot be projected.</div>

<div class="question">10. Define critical angle and total internal reflection.</div>
<div class="answer">Critical angle is the angle of incidence in a denser medium for which the angle of refraction in rarer medium is 90°. Total internal reflection occurs when incidence angle > critical angle.</div>

<div class="question">11. What is refraction through a prism?</div>
<div class="answer">It is the bending of light passing through a prism, causing deviation and dispersion of colors.</div>

<div class="question">12. Define lateral inversion in mirrors.</div>
<div class="answer">Lateral inversion is the reversal of an image in a mirror from left to right.</div>

<div class="question">13. What is a concave mirror used for?</div>
<div class="answer">Concave mirrors are used in headlights, shaving mirrors, and telescopes to focus light.</div>

<div class="question">14. What is a convex mirror used for?</div>
<div class="answer">Convex mirrors are used in vehicles as rear-view mirrors for a wider field of view.</div>

<div class="question">15. Define spherical aberration.</div>
<div class="answer">Spherical aberration is the failure of rays to meet at a single point after reflection/refraction due to spherical surface shape.</div>

<div class="question">16. What is dispersion in optics?</div>
<div class="answer">Dispersion is the separation of white light into its constituent colors.</div>

<div class="question">17. Explain the principle of a microscope.</div>
<div class="answer">A microscope uses two convex lenses to magnify small objects in steps: objective lens forms an image, eyepiece magnifies it further.</div>

<div class="question">18. What is the role of a telescope?</div>
<div class="answer">A telescope gathers more light than the eye and magnifies distant objects using lenses or mirrors.</div>

<div class="question">19. Define reflection of sound.</div>
<div class="answer">Reflection of sound is the bouncing back of sound waves from a surface without absorption.</div>

<div class="question">20. What is an echo?</div>
<div class="answer">An echo is the reflected sound heard after a time delay from the original sound.</div>

<div class="question">21. What is reverberation?</div>
<div class="answer">Reverberation is the persistence of sound in an enclosed space due to multiple reflections.</div>

<div class="question">22. Define pitch and loudness of sound.</div>
<div class="answer">Pitch depends on frequency, loudness depends on amplitude of sound waves.</div>

<div class="question">23. Explain the Doppler effect.</div>
<div class="answer">Change in frequency of sound due to relative motion between source and observer.</div>

<div class="question">24. What is the velocity of sound in air?</div>
<div class="answer">Approximately 343 m/s at 20°C.</div>

<div class="question">25. What is refraction of sound?</div>
<div class="answer">Bending of sound waves when they pass through regions of different air density.</div>

<div class="question">26. Define frequency and wavelength.</div>
<div class="answer">Frequency is number of oscillations per second; wavelength is distance between two consecutive crests.</div>

<div class="question">27. What is resonance?</div>
<div class="answer">Resonance occurs when the frequency of forced vibration matches the natural frequency of an object, producing large amplitude.</div>

<div class="question">28. Explain pitch of musical notes.</div>
<div class="answer">Higher frequency gives higher pitch, lower frequency gives lower pitch.</div>

<div class="question">29. Define intensity of sound.</div>
<div class="answer">Sound intensity is power per unit area carried by the wave.</div>

<div class="question">30. What is the relationship between wavelength, frequency, and speed?</div>
<div class="answer">v = f × λ, where v is speed, f is frequency, λ is wavelength.</div>

<div class="question">31. Define amplitude of wave.</div>
<div class="answer">Amplitude is the maximum displacement of particles from their mean position.</div>

<div class="question">32. What is constructive and destructive interference?</div>
<div class="answer">Constructive interference: waves add up; destructive interference: waves cancel each other.</div>

<div class="question">33. Explain longitudinal and transverse waves.</div>
<div class="answer">Longitudinal waves: particles vibrate parallel to direction of wave; Transverse: perpendicular.</div>

<div class="question">34. What is the effect of temperature on speed of sound?</div>
<div class="answer">Speed of sound increases with temperature.</div>

<div class="question">35. Define ultra sound and its applications.</div>
<div class="answer">Ultrasound: sound waves above 20 kHz, used in medical imaging, cleaning, and detection.</div>

<div class="question">36. Define shock wave.</div>
<div class="answer">A shock wave is a sudden change in pressure caused by objects moving faster than the speed of sound.</div>

<div class="question">37. What is the principle of hearing in humans?</div>
<div class="answer">Sound waves enter ear, cause vibration of eardrum, transmitted via ossicles to cochlea, stimulating nerves.</div>
