            <p>Mrs. Pumphrey's dog Tricki falls ill due to overfeeding and lack of exercise. Despite being given various medications and special treatments, Tricki's condition worsens.</p>
            
            <p>Veterinary surgeon Mr. Herriot realizes that Tricki's problem is not medical but lifestyle-related. He decides to hospitalize Tricki away from Mrs. Pumphrey's pampering. At the surgery, Tricki is put on a strict diet and gets proper exercise with other dogs.</p>
            
            <p>Within days, Tricki transforms into a healthy, active dog. Mrs. Pumphrey believes it's a "triumph of surgery," though the real cure was simple discipline and healthy habits.</p>
