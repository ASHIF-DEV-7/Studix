            <div class="question">Q1. Explain the role of women in the nationalist struggles in India.</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Women played a significant role in India's nationalist movements. They actively participated in protests, marches, and civil disobedience campaigns led by Mahatma Gandhi. Figures like Sarojini Naidu, Annie Besant, and Kasturba Gandhi mobilized other women and contributed to the movement. Their involvement challenged traditional gender roles and helped broaden the base of the freedom struggle.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="question-block">
            <div class="question">Q2. How did the First World War create a new political and economic situation in India?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>The war led to a sharp increase in defense expenditure, which was financed by war loans and increased taxes. This created an inflationary period with rising prices, causing great hardship for the common people. It also led to forced recruitment in rural areas, which caused widespread anger. This new situation provided the context for the growth of nationalist movements.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="question-block">
            <div class="question">Q3. What was the impact of the Great Depression on the Indian economy?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>The Great Depression severely affected the Indian economy. Agricultural prices plummeted, and exports declined, which hit the peasants and farmers the hardest. The colonial government, however, continued to demand high revenue, forcing farmers to sell their land and assets. This led to widespread distress and further fueled the nationalist struggle.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question-block">
            <div class="question">Q4. Describe the Dandi March.</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>The Dandi March was a significant act of civil disobedience led by Mahatma Gandhi. On March 12, 1930, he began the march from his Sabarmati Ashram to the coastal town of Dandi, with 78 of his followers. The goal was to violate the British salt law by manufacturing salt from seawater. The march covered over 240 miles and sparked widespread civil disobedience across India, making it a pivotal moment in the freedom struggle.</p>

        </div>
        
        <div class="question-block">
            <div class="question">Q5. Explain the concept of 'Satyagraha' as advocated by Mahatma Gandhi.</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Satyagraha means 'truth-force.' It was a method of nonviolent resistance to injustice. According to Gandhi, a satyagrahi does not inflict pain on the oppressor but seeks to convert him through the power of truth and nonviolence. It emphasized the power of truth and the need to search for truth, suggesting that if the cause was true, the struggle against injustice could be won without physical force.</p>

        <div class="question-block">
            <div class="question">Q6. How did the growth of nationalism in Europe lead to the formation of nation-states?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Nationalism in Europe transformed from a feeling of loyalty to a monarch or empire to a belief in a shared identity based on language, culture, and history. This led to movements for unification and independence, such as the unification of Germany and Italy. People demanded a state where they could live as a cohesive community with shared values, leading to the overthrow of old monarchies and the creation of new nation-states.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question-block">
            <div class="question">Q7. Who was Giuseppe Mazzini and what was his contribution to the unification of Italy?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Giuseppe Mazzini was an Italian revolutionary and a founder of 'Young Italy,' a secret society. He believed in a unified Italian Republic. Though his early attempts at revolution failed, his ideas inspired subsequent generations of nationalists. He is considered the 'spiritual force' behind the unification of Italy, as his vision of a free and unified nation fueled the movement.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="question-block">
            <div class="question">Q8. How did industrialization affect society in 19th-century Europe?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Industrialization led to massive social changes. It created new social classes, such as the industrial working class and the middle class. It also led to rapid urbanization, with people moving to cities for factory jobs. This created problems like crowded housing, poor sanitation, and long working hours, which gave rise to socialist and labor movements.</p>
            </div>

        <h2 class="section-heading">Political Science</h2>

        <div class="question-block">
            <div class="question">Q9. Explain the concept of 'power sharing.' Why is it desirable?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Power sharing is a system of political arrangements in which power is shared among different organs of government, different levels of government, and different social groups. It is desirable because it reduces the possibility of conflict between social groups, ensures stability, and upholds the spirit of democracy. It prevents the concentration of power in one hand, which could lead to tyranny.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="question-block">
            <div class="question">Q10. How is a 'federal system' of government different from a 'unitary system'?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>In a **federal system**, power is divided between a central authority and various constituent units of the country. Both levels of government enjoy their own jurisdiction. In a **unitary system**, there is only one level of government, or the sub-units are subordinate to the central government. The central government can pass on orders to the local governments. India is an example of a federal system, while the UK is largely a unitary state.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="question-block">
            <div class="question">Q11. What are the key features of the federal system in India?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Key features include a **two-tier system** of government (Union and State), a **written constitution**, the **division of powers** between the Union and State lists, and an **independent judiciary** to resolve disputes. The constitution is supreme, and its provisions can only be changed with the consent of both levels of government.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="question-block">
            <div class="question">Q12. How do political parties contribute to democracy?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Political parties are crucial for the functioning of democracy. They **contest elections**, **form governments**, and **act as the opposition** to hold the government accountable. They help shape public opinion, provide a platform for citizens to participate in politics, and connect the government with the public.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question-block">
            <div class="question">Q13. What is the difference between a national party and a state party in India?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>A party is recognized as a **national party** if it secures at least 6% of the total votes in a Lok Sabha or Assembly election in four states and wins at least four seats in the Lok Sabha. A **state party** needs to secure at least 6% of the total votes in an Assembly election of a state and win at least two seats.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question-block">
            <div class="question">Q14. What are the major challenges faced by political parties in India?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Challenges include the **dynastic succession** of leadership, the increasing role of **money and muscle power** in elections, the lack of **internal democracy** within parties, and a general decline in the meaningful choice available to voters.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question-block">
            <div class="question">Q15. How does caste play a role in Indian politics?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Caste influences Indian politics in several ways. Parties often field candidates from castes dominant in a particular constituency. They appeal to caste sentiments and mobilize voters along caste lines. However, no single caste can win an election, so parties have to build coalitions across castes and communities. Caste politics is a complex reality, but it's not the sole determinant of voting behavior.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question-block">
            <div class="question">Q16. Explain the concept of 'secularism' in the Indian context.</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Indian secularism means that the state does not have an official religion and treats all religions equally. It allows citizens the freedom to practice, profess, and propagate any religion. The state maintains a principled distance from religion, intervening only when necessary to ensure social harmony or to protect the rights of minority groups.</p>

        <h2 class="section-heading">Economics</h2>

        <div class="question-block">
            <div class="question">Q17. What is meant by 'development'? How is it measured?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Development is a comprehensive term that includes economic growth, improved standard of living, and social well-being. It's measured by various indicators, with the most common being **Per Capita Income**. Other indicators include the Human Development Index (HDI), which considers health (life expectancy), education (literacy rate), and living standards (per capita income).</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="question-block">
            <div class="question">Q18. Differentiate between the 'primary,' 'secondary,' and 'tertiary' sectors.</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>The **primary sector** involves direct use of natural resources (e.g., agriculture, mining). The **secondary sector** transforms raw materials into finished goods (e.g., manufacturing, construction). The **tertiary sector** provides services (e.g., banking, education, transport). These sectors are interdependent, with the tertiary sector providing support to the other two.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="question-block">
            <div class="question">Q19. What is 'disguised unemployment'? Give an example.</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Disguised unemployment is a situation where more people are employed in a sector than are actually needed. Even if some of the workers are removed, the output of the sector will not be affected. An example is a farming family of seven where only five are needed to cultivate the land. The extra two members are 'disguisedly' unemployed, as their contribution to the output is zero.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question-block">
            <div class="question">Q20. How does the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) supervise the functioning of formal sources of loans?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>The RBI supervises banks to ensure they don't just give loans to profit-making businesses but also to small borrowers, farmers, and industries. It monitors banks' cash reserve ratio (CRR) and requires them to submit a report on how much they are lending and to whom, ensuring fair lending practices.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="question-block">
            <div class="question">Q21. Explain the role of 'money' as a medium of exchange.</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Money acts as a medium of exchange because it can be used to purchase goods and services. It solves the problem of 'double coincidence of wants,' which is required in a barter system. With money, a buyer doesn't need to find a seller who wants exactly what the buyer has in exchange for what they need.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question-block">
            <div class="question">Q22. What are 'self-help groups' (SHGs)? How do they help the poor?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>SHGs are small groups of 15-20 members, mostly women, who save money together and provide small loans to members at a reasonable interest rate. They help the poor by providing an alternative to formal loans, which are often inaccessible due to lack of collateral. They also help members become financially self-reliant and create a platform for social and economic empowerment.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question-block">
            <div class="question">Q23. Differentiate between a formal and an informal sector loan.</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Formal sector loans are from banks and cooperatives, regulated by the RBI, and have low interest rates and set terms. Informal sector loans are from moneylenders, traders, and friends, are not regulated, and often have very high interest rates and exploitative terms. The formal sector is preferable as it offers fair and transparent conditions.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question-block">
            <div class="question">Q24. How has globalization affected the Indian economy?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Globalization has led to increased competition for domestic producers, but also new opportunities. Consumers now have a wider range of products and at lower prices. It has created new jobs in sectors like IT and BPO. However, it has also led to job losses in some industries and increased economic inequality.</p>

        <h2 class="section-heading">Geography</h2>

        <div class="question-block">
            <div class="question">Q25. What is 'soil erosion'? Describe two methods of soil conservation.</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Soil erosion is the denudation of the soil cover and subsequent washing down of the topsoil. Two methods of soil conservation are **contour ploughing** (ploughing parallel to the contours of a hill slope to reduce water flow) and **terracing** (creating steps on slopes to control erosion and allow farming).</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="question-block">
            <div class="question">Q26. Describe the importance of 'water harvesting' in India.</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Water harvesting is the collection and storage of rainwater for future use. It is crucial in India due to uneven rainfall and water scarcity in many regions. It recharges groundwater, reduces urban flooding, and provides a sustainable water source for irrigation and domestic use, especially in drought-prone areas.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="question-block">
            <div class="question">Q27. Why are 'multipurpose river projects' criticized?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Multipurpose river projects are criticized for various reasons. They can lead to the displacement of local communities, loss of biodiversity, and soil degradation. The construction of large dams can cause seismic activity and environmental damage. The projects often don't deliver on their promises of equitable water distribution and can lead to inter-state water disputes.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="question-block">
            <div class="question">Q28. What are the major challenges faced by the sugar industry in India?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Challenges include the seasonal nature of the industry, the high cost of production, the old and inefficient methods used in some mills, and the need to transport sugarcane over long distances, which reduces its sucrose content. Additionally, the industry is often in conflict with cane farmers over payment and prices.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question-block">
            <div class="question">Q29. Explain the importance of 'air transport' in India.</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Air transport is the fastest mode of travel and is crucial for remote, hilly, and inaccessible areas. It is vital for international trade and travel, connecting India to the world. It is also important for carrying high-value goods and for emergency services during natural disasters.</p>

        <div class="question-block">
            <div class="question">Q30. Differentiate between 'conventional' and 'non-conventional' sources of energy.</div>
    <div class="answer">
                <p>**Conventional sources** are those that have been in common use for a long time, are non-renewable, and cause pollution (e.g., coal, petroleum). **Non-conventional sources** are recently developed, renewable, and environmentally friendly (e.g., solar, wind, and geothermal energy). India is increasingly focusing on the latter to meet its energy needs sustainably.</p>

        <div class="question-block">
            <div class="question">Q31. How is 'sustainable development' a necessity in the present time?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Sustainable development is crucial because current patterns of growth are depleting resources and causing severe environmental degradation. It aims to meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. It emphasizes a balance between economic development, environmental protection, and social equity.</p>
            </div>

        <div class="question-block">
            <div class="question">Q32. What are the key characteristics of 'plantation agriculture'?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Plantation agriculture is a type of commercial farming where a single crop is grown over a large area. It is a labor-intensive system requiring capital-intensive inputs. The produce is processed on the farm itself or in nearby factories. Examples include tea, coffee, and rubber plantations in India.</p>

            <div class="answer">
                <p>Roads are more important because they offer door-to-door service and can be built in more difficult terrains like hills and deserts. They are a key link to other forms of transport like railways and seaports. Roads are also more flexible for short-distance travel and transportation of perishable goods.</p>
