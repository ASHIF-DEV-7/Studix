            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>Richard Ebright showed scientific curiosity from childhood. He started collecting butterflies and rocks, but his interest deepened when his mother bought him a book called "The Travels of Monarch X."</p>
            
            <p>He began researching monarch butterflies and discovered the purpose of gold spots on their pupae. His project won first prize in the county science fair.</p>
            
            <p>In high school, he discovered an unknown insect hormone and later found how cells can read the blueprint of DNA. His work earned him many prestigious awards, including the Searle Scholar Award.</p>
