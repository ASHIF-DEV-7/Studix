        <h3>Currency</h3>
        <div class="important">
            <p>Currency includes <span class="highlight">paper notes and coins</span> issued by the central bank (Reserve Bank of India). It is accepted as a medium of exchange because it is authorized by the government.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Deposits with Banks</h3>

        </div>

        <h2><span class="section-number">3.4</span> How Banks Work</h2>

        <h3>Bank's Business Model</h3>
        <div class="formula">
            Bank's Profit = Interest Earned on Loans - Interest Paid on Deposits - Operating Expenses
        </div>

        <h4>Process:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Banks accept deposits from customers</li>
            <li>Pay interest on these deposits (usually 3-6% annually)</li>
            <li>Lend this money to borrowers at higher interest rates (8-15% annually)</li>
            <li>Keep some money as cash reserves for daily transactions</li>
            <li>The difference between lending rate and deposit rate is bank's income</li>
        </ol>

        <div class="example">
            <h4>Example:</h4>
            <p>ABC Bank collects ₹100 crores as deposits and pays 4% interest = ₹4 crores. It lends ₹80 crores at 12% interest = ₹9.6 crores. Bank's gross income = ₹9.6 - ₹4 = ₹5.6 crores.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR)</h3>
        <div class="definition">
            <p>Banks must keep a certain percentage of their deposits as cash reserves with RBI. Currently, CRR is around 4%. This ensures banks have enough liquidity for withdrawals.</p>
        </div>

        <h2><span class="section-number">3.5</span> Credit and Loans</h2>

        <h3>What is Credit?</h3>
        <div class="definition">
            <h4>Credit:</h4>
            <p>Credit refers to an agreement where the borrower receives money or resources with the promise to repay the lender in the future, usually with interest.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Terms of Credit</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Interest Rate:</strong> Extra money to be paid along with repayment</li>
            <li><strong>Collateral:</strong> Asset owned by borrower used as guarantee</li>
            <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> Proof of employment, income, identity</li>
            <li><strong>Mode of Repayment:</strong> How and when loan will be repaid</li>
        </ol>

        <div class="example">
            <h4>Example of Terms of Credit:</h4>
            <p>Priya wants a loan of ₹2 lakh for her small business:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Interest Rate: 10% per annum</li>
                <li>Collateral: Her shop as security</li>

        <h2><span class="section-number">3.7</span> Self-Help Groups (SHGs)</h2>

        <div class="definition">
            <h4>Self-Help Groups:</h4>
            <p>Small groups of 15-20 people from similar economic backgrounds who save regularly and lend to members in need. They bridge the gap between formal and informal credit.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>How SHGs Work</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Group members save small amounts regularly (₹50-100 per month)</li>
            <li>Money is pooled together in a common fund</li>
            <li>Members can borrow from this fund for various needs</li>
            <li>Interest charged is much lower than moneylenders</li>
            <li>After establishing good track record, banks provide loans to the group</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Advantages of SHGs</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Easy access to credit for poor people</li>
            <li>Lower interest rates compared to informal sources</li>
            <li>Develops saving habit</li>
            <li>Women empowerment</li>
            <li>No collateral required</li>
            <li>Flexible repayment terms</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="example">
            <h4>Example:</h4>
            <p>Meera joins a SHG with 19 other women. Each saves ₹100 monthly. After 6 months, the group has ₹12,000. When Meera needs ₹5,000 for her daughter's education, she borrows from the group at 12% annual interest instead of going to a moneylender who charges 36%.</p>
        </div>

        <h2><span class="section-number">3.8</span> Problems with Informal Credit</h2>

        <h3>High Interest Rates</h3>
        <p>Informal lenders charge very high interest rates, sometimes 3-5% per month (36-60% annually), which can trap borrowers in debt cycles.</p>

        <h3>Unfair Practices</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>No proper documentation of loan terms</li>
            <li>Harassment for repayment</li>
            <li>Seizure of collateral without proper legal process</li>
            <li>Compound interest calculations</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Debt Trap</h3>
