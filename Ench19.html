                <p>Belinda lived in a little white house,<br>
                With a little black kitten and a little grey mouse,<br>

                But the dragon was a coward, and she called him Custard.</p>
                
                <p>Custard the dragon had big sharp teeth,<br>
                And spikes on top of him and scales underneath,<br>

            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>Belinda lives with her pets: Ink (kitten), Blink (mouse), Mustard (dog), and Custard (dragon). While the other pets boast about their bravery, Custard is seen as a coward who always cries for a safe cage.</p>
            
            <p>One day, a pirate breaks into the house. All the brave pets run away and hide, but Custard fights the pirate bravely and defeats him. After the danger passes, the other pets claim they would have been braver, but Belinda embraces Custard, and they all live happily together.</p>
