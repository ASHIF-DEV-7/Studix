            <h2>The Poem</h2>
            <div class="poem">
                <p>I think I could turn and live with animals, they are so placid and self-contain'd,<br>
                I stand and look at them long and long.</p>
                
                <p>They do not sweat and whine about their condition,<br>
                They do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their sins,<br>
                They do not make me sick discussing their duty to God,</p>
                
                <p>Not one is dissatisfied, not one is demented with the mania of owning things,<br>
                Not one kneels to another, nor to his kind that lived thousands of years ago,<br>
                Not one is respectable or unhappy over the whole earth.</p>
                
                <p>So they show their relations to me and I accept them,<br>
                They bring me tokens of myself, they evince them plainly in their possession<br>
                I wonder where they get those tokens,<br>
                Did I pass that way huge times ago and negligently drop them?</p>
