    <ol>
        <li class="question">Explain the process of photosynthesis with the balanced equation. (3 marks)
            <p class="answer">Answer: Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants convert CO₂ and H₂O into glucose using sunlight and chlorophyll. Equation: 6CO₂ + 6H₂O → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂ (in presence of sunlight and chlorophyll).</p>
