        <h2><strong>Conclusion (7–8 Lines)</strong></h2>
        <p>
            <strong>The Sermon at Benares</strong> teaches that death is a natural law of life. <br><br>
            Every living being must face old age, sickness and death. <br><br>
            Running away from sorrow or begging for miracles cannot stop this truth. <br><br>
            Real peace comes from accepting reality and ending desires. <br><br>
            Buddha’s Middle Path shows a way to live with balance and compassion. <br><br>
            The story of Kisa Gotami proves that suffering is shared by all humans. <br><br>
            By understanding this, we become calm, wise and free from unnecessary pain.
